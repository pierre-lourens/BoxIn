# BoxIn
BoxIn is an app for better planning your tasks and protecting your limited time.

**Created in a one week sprint as I wrapped up Project Shift**

With it, you can easily drag and drop tasks into boxes of time that you create. Frictionless time tracking allows you to review data about your tasks, in order to better predict how long tasks will take in the future.

### Technologies Used:
- React/Redux
- Express/Node/MongoDB
